# Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Atari Games

This repository contains an implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for playing Atari games. The DQN algorithm, introduced by Mnih et al. in the paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf), combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to achieve impressive results in a variety of Atari 2600 games.

## Overview

### Deep Q-Network (DQN)

The Deep Q-Network is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that extends Q-learning to handle high-dimensional state spaces. It employs a neural network to approximate the Q-function, which represents the expected cumulative future rewards for taking a specific action in a given state. This allows DQN to learn directly from raw sensory inputs, making it applicable to a wide range of tasks.

### Atari Games

The Atari 2600, a popular home video game console in the late 1970s and early 1980s, featured a diverse collection of games. These games serve as a benchmark for testing the capabilities of reinforcement learning algorithms. Each game in the Atari 2600 suite provides a unique environment with different challenges, making them an ideal testbed for training agents to generalize across a variety of tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Gym (OpenAI)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-q-network-atari.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train and evaluate the DQN agent, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Set up the required dependencies as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

2. Train the DQN agent:

```bash
python train.py --game <game_name>
```

Replace `<game_name>` with the name of the Atari game you want to train the agent on (e.g., `Pong`, `Breakout`, etc.).

3. Evaluate the trained agent:

```bash
python evaluate.py --game <game_name> --model <model_path>
```

Replace `<game_name>` with the name of the Atari game and `<model_path>` with the path to the trained model.

## Training

The training process involves the following steps:

1. Preprocess raw game frames to reduce dimensionality.
2. Initialize a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function.
3. Initialize a replay buffer to store experiences.
4. For each episode, perform the following steps:
   - Select an action using an epsilon-greedy policy.
   - Execute the action in the environment and observe the next state, reward, and terminal flag.
   - Store the experience in the replay buffer.
   - Sample a batch of experiences from the replay buffer and perform a Q-learning update step.
   - Update the target Q-network periodically.

## Evaluation

The evaluation process involves testing the trained DQN agent on a specific game. The agent's performance is measured in terms of the average score achieved over a specified number of episodes.

## Results

### Game: `<game_name>`

Insert qualitative and/or quantitative results, such as graphs showing learning curves, final scores achieved, etc.
